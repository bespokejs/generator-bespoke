# Bespoke.js Generator

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/bespokejs/generator-bespoke/master.svg?style=flat-square)](http://travis-ci.org/bespokejs/generator-bespoke)

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator that scaffolds a project for a [Bespoke.js](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js) presentation.

## Features

The boilerplate project this generator creates includes a [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) build system, a preview server with [LiveReload](http://livereload.com), and a [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) deployment task.
The project is also setup to perform [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) compilation and, optionally, [Pug (formerly Jade)](https://pugjs.org) or [AsciiDoc](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-bespoke) conversion to HTML, depending on the templating engine you chose.

The following [Bespoke.js plugins](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke#plugins) are always included by default:

- [bespoke-classes](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-classes)
- [bespoke-nav](https://github.com/opendevise/bespoke-nav)
- [bespoke-scale](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-scale)
- [bespoke-bullets](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-bullets)
- [bespoke-hash](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-hash)
- [bespoke-extern](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-extern)

Based on your responses to the prompts in the generator, your presentation may also include the following optional plugins:

- [bespoke-prism](https://github.com/opendevise/bespoke-prism)
- [bespoke-multimedia](https://github.com/opendevise/bespoke-multimedia)

## Prerequisites

In order to use this project, you must first satisify the prerequisites of Bespoke.js.

- Node.js >= 0.12
  * _We strongly recommend that you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your Node.js installation._
- Gulp (command line interface only)
  ```bash
  $ npm install -g gulp-cli
  ```

## Usage

Once you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), install the `generator-bespoke` package globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-bespoke
```

Create a new directory and switch to it:

```bash
$ mkdir presentation-hello-world
$ cd presentation-hello-world
```

> **IMPORTANT** If you're planning to create an AsciiDoc-based presentation, be ready for the generator to execute the `bundle install` command.
> This command is used to install the [Asciidoctor Bespoke](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-bespoke) gem and its dependencies.
> The gems are installed to the local _.bundle/gems_ directory.
>
> If you use RVM to manage Ruby, switch to your preferred Ruby version using `rvm use` (e.g., `rvm use 2.4.2`) **before** running the next command.
> You may also want to declare your preferred Ruby version in the file named _.ruby-version_ at the root of the project.
>
> If you use a different Ruby selector, make sure your Ruby environment is prepared to run `bundle install`.

Scaffold a new presentation using:

```bash
$ yo bespoke
```

If you want the generator to skip `npm install` (and also `bundle install` for an AsciiDoc-based presentation), set the `skip-install` switch to false:

```bash
$ yo bespoke --skip-install
```

You'll then be instructed to execute the the commands that the generator skipped.

Refer to the README at the root of the generated project for instructions on how to get started developing your new presentation.

## Presentation Workflow

All source files for the presentation reside in the `src` directory.

Build the presentation and start a local preview server using:

```bash
$ gulp serve
```

Once the server is running, you can view the slides by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
The build will continue monitoring for changes, so you can work on the presentation and preview it in real time.

Build the presentation without starting the local preview server using:

```bash
$ gulp
```

The files are built into the _dist_ directory.
You can view the slides by navigating to _dist/index.html_ in your browser.

Compile and publish to GitHub Pages, assuming a git repo with `origin` pointing to GitHub, using:

```bash
$ gulp publish
```

## Generator Tests

Tests require Node.js 4.4+.
Everything created by those tests (files and directories) is located in the user's temporary folder.

First, clone the git repository and switch to the project:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:bespokejs/generator-bespoke.git
$ cd generator-bespoke
```

If you're using nvm to manage your Node.js installation, switch to at least Node.js 4.4+.

```bash
nvm use 4.4
```

Next, install the development dependencies into the project:

```bash
$ npm i
```

Finally, run the tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

The tests verify basic behaviour about the plugin, including:

* Checks that `yo bespoke` generates correct files for different templating options (Pug, AsciiDoc, HTML)
* Checks that after a `yo bespoke`, `gulp serve` provides a local server with a working Bespoke.js slide deck
* Checks that after a `yo bespoke`, `gulp build` generates correct files
