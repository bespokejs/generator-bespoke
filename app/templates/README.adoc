A {uri-bespoke}[Bespoke.js] presentation generated by {uri-generator-bespoke}[generator-bespoke].

== View slides locally

First, ensure you have the following installed:

. {uri-node}[Node.js] >= 4.2 footnote:[We strongly recommend using {uri-nvm}[nvm] to manage Node.]
<% if (useAsciiDoc) { -%>
. {uri-ruby}[Ruby >= 2] footnote:[We strongly recommend using {uri-rvm}[RVM] to manage Ruby.]

 $ rvm use 3.2.0 --install # optional
<% } -%>

Next, install dependencies (if you ran the generator with the `--skip-install` switch):

 $ npm i
<% if (useAsciiDoc) { -%>
   bundle config set --local path .bundle/gems 
   bundle
<% } -%>

Finally, build and serve the presentation!

 $ npx gulp serve

You can view the presentation in your browser at the URL displayed in the console.

By default, the preview server runs on port 8080.
To change this default, you can assign a different number to the PORT environment variable:

 $ PORT=8888 npx gulp serve

To build the presentation without starting the preview server, use:

 $ npx gulp

In both cases, the files are built into the [.path]_dist_ directory.
You can view the slides outside of the local preview server by navigating to [.path]_dist/index.html_ in your browser.

== Publish to GitHub Pages

The Gulp build includes a task to publish your presentation to GitHub Pages.

First, make sure you have initialized the project as a git repository and linked it to a GitHub project.
The task assumes that the git remote named `origin` points to the repository on GitHub.

Now you can build the presentation and publish it to GitHub Pages using:

 $ npx gulp publish

The files in the [.path]_dist_ directory end up in the `gh-pages` branch in the repository on GitHub.
From there, they can be viewed in a browser from anywhere on the web.
